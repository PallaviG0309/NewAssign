Q- What is limitation in switch case?
A- Switch statement is a powerful statement used to handle many alternatives and provides good presentation for C program.
   But there are some limitations with switch statement which are given below:
    Logical operators cannot be used with switch statement. For instance
    case k>=20:
    is not allowed
    Switch case variables can have only int and char data type. So float or no data type is allowed.
    For instance in the switch syntax given below:
    switch(ch)
    {
    case 1:
    statement-1;
    break;
    case 2:
    statement-2;
    break;
    }
    In this ch can be integer or char and cannot be float or any other data type.
  
Q- Why do we need break in switch case?
A- You can use the break statement to end processing of a particular labeled statement within the switch statement. It branches to the end of the switch statement. 
   Without break , the program continues to the next labeled statement, executing the statements until a break or the end of the statement is reached.
